# CUDA-Based PDE Solver

This repository contains my initial attempt at solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using CUDA programming for parallel computing. It demonstrates how GPU acceleration can be used to efficiently solve PDEs in a high-performance computing environment.

## Features
- Solves a simple PDE using CUDA.
- Leverages parallel computing to speed up calculations.
- Provides a foundation for experimenting with GPU-based numerical methods.
